# AWS-Data-Lake-Solution-with-Analytics
Data analytics project building an AWS Data Lake pipeline using S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena, Lake Formation, and QuickSight to integrate raw datasets, enforce governance, and deliver secure, real-time insights for scalable business decision-making.


# AWS Data Lake Implementation – COSUE Energy Case Study  

This repository demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a **Data Lake on AWS** using the fictional company **COSUE Energy** as a case study.  
The project highlights how AWS services can break down data silos, improve scalability, and enable advanced analytics for better decision-making.

## Problem Statement  
COSUE Energy faced:  
- Fragmented data across multiple silos.  
- Limited scalability with traditional infrastructure.  
- Inefficient analytics and delayed insights.  

---

## Legacy Architecture  
COSUE Energy’s legacy data infrastructure was fragmented across multiple systems:  
- On-premise SQL databases for structured data.  
- File servers for logs and semi-structured data.  
- Isolated BI tools with no unified access layer.  
- Limited scalability and slow reporting.

## ☁️ Modern AWS Data Lake Architecture  
With AWS, COSUE Energy implemented a **centralized Data Lake** that:  
- Ingests all data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) into **Amazon S3**.  
- Uses **AWS Glue + Lambda** for ETL and metadata cataloging.  
- Provides query access via **Athena & Redshift Spectrum**.  
- Enables visualization with **QuickSight dashboards**.  
- Ensures governance/security with **Lake Formation & IAM**.

##  Solution Approach  
We implemented a **centralized Data Lake** architecture on AWS to:  
- Integrate diverse data sources into a single repository.  
- Ensure cost-effective and scalable storage on Amazon S3.  
- Enable analytics using **Athena, Redshift Spectrum, and QuickSight**.  
- Automate ingestion and transformation using **Glue, Lambda, and CloudWatch**.  
- Maintain strong security and governance with **IAM & Lake Formation**.  

---

##  Key Results  
-  **40% faster data processing**  
-  **35% reduction in data management costs**  
-  **60% improvement in analytics efficiency**  
-  **45% faster time-to-insight**  
-  **3x scalability for future growth**
